# Naive-Bayes-Netflix-Predictor

## Content
This repository contains my implementation of the Naive Bayes learning algorithm to predict a user's rating of a target movie, in this case, Love Actually as a 5. The data used is from Reed Hastings and was processed by Chris Piech. Data was then split into training and testing datasets, composed of 100 and 500 data vectors respectively, with each data vector containing 21 binary input features representing the user's rating for 20 movies and the target movie. Finally, the output class indicated (in binary) the prediction of whether the user rated the target movie, Love Actually, as a 5.
